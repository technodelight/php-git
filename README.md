# php-git
Small PHP wrapper library around `git` shell.

# Install

Via composer.
```
composer require technodelight/php-git
```

# Dependecies

This tool uses `git` through the current active shell it's running in.
There are methods which are dependent on `sed`, `head` and `grep` too.

# Usage

```php
<?php

$git = new Technodelight\GitShell\Api(
    new Technodelight\ShellExec\Exec('/usr/bin/env git')
);

// read git log entries
foreach ($git->log('develop', 'head') as $logEntry) {
    // $logEntry is an instance of Technodelight\GitShell\LogEntry here
}

// create a branch
$git->createBranch('my-precious-branch'); // return is void, but will throw exception on error

// switch to a branch
$git->switchBranch('develop');

// list remotes, optionally verbose mode
$git->remotes(); // runs git remote, returns 'origin' for example
$git->remotes(true); // runs git remote -v, returns a Technodelight\GitShell\Remote instance

// show branches, with optional filter, optionally with remotes
$git->branches();
$git->branches('feature/'); // this uses grep command in the background
$git->branches('', true); // each call will return a Technodelight\GitShell\Branch instance with remote

// retrieve the current branch
$git->currentBranch(); // instance of Technodelight\GitShell\Branch will be returned

// find the top level directory for current directory
$git->topLevelDirectory(); // returns false if not in a git dir, a path (string) otherwise

// show git diff
$git->diff(); // Technodelight\GitShell\DiffEntry object for current changes
$git->diff('develop'); // changes since last commit on develop
```
